            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Akira Toriyama (Toriyama Akira, April 5, 1955 – March 1, 2024) was a Japanese manga artist and character designer. He came to be regarded as one of the most important authors in the history of manga, authoring highly influential and popular series, particularly Dragon Ball.
                Toriyama first achieved mainstream recognition for creating the manga series <strong>Dr. Slump</strong>, for which he earned the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award for best shōnen/shōjo. Dr. Slump went on to sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into an anime, with a second series created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended.
From 1984 to 1995 he wrote and illustrated the <strong>Dragon Ball</strong> manga, serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump. It became one of the best-selling manga series of all time, with 260 million copies sold worldwide, and is considered a key work in increasing manga circulation to its peak in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, Dragon Ball's anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and similarly boosted anime's general popularity.
                Beside his manga works Toriyama acted as a character designer for several video games such as the Dragon Quest series, <strong>Chrono Trigger</strong>, and Blue Dragon.</p>

            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Akira Toriyama was born in the town of Kiyosu, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He had a younger sister.
                Toriyama drew pictures since a young age, mainly of the animals and vehicles that he was fond of.
                He related being blown away after seeing One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), and said he was drawn deeper into the world of illustration by hoping to draw pictures that good.
                He was shocked again in elementary school when he saw the manga collection of a classmate's older brother, and again when he saw a television set for the first time at a neighbor's house. He cited Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy (1952–1968) as the original source for his interest in manga.</p>

            <h3>Career</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Inspired by the novel Journey to the West, Dragon Ball started off as an adaptation of it, but with humor and martial arts added in. Quickly, the manga grew in popularity and the plot developed to focus more on the martial arts aspect of it. The original manga was adapted into an anime in 1986, continuing for a decade alongside the manga, which spanned 42 volumes and ended in June 1995. Altogether, the manga has sold over 260 million copies worldwide, as well as led to a continuation of the series in 2015 in Dragon Ball Super, which is currently ongoing under the helm of manga artist Toyotarou. However, the anime has been on hiatus since 2018, with a new series, Dragon Ball Daima, being worked on prior to Toriyama’s death.
                Despite his involvement in Dragon Ball, Toriyama worked on many other side projects. He wrote short stories such as Sand Land, worked on character designs for the Dragon Quest series of games, and worked on the game “Chrono Trigger”.
                A few of Toriyama’s friends have since written tributes to the artist on Dragon Ball’s publisher Shueisha’s website. Eiichiro Oda, the creator of One Piece, said “I have admired him so much since I was a child, so I remember the day he called me by name for the first time. On the way home from the day you used the word “friend” for me and Kishimoto, I remember being overjoyed with Kishimoto… With respect and gratitude for the creative world he has left behind. I pray for his soulful rest in peace. May heaven be the joyous world he envisioned.” In addition to him, Toriyama heavily inspired Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto, who wrote, “Thank you, Akira Toriyama, for all of your enjoyable works over the past 45 years.”
                Toriyama is regarded as one of the most influential manga artists in the history of manga, and few can claim the status that he gained through his career. He still had several works in the middle of being created before his passing, which his studio, Bird Studio, announced in their public statement regarding his passing. His legacy spans generations of fans, as well as in many other works. As he said in his last volume of Dragon Ball, “Tackle life with as much energy as Goku! I’ll try to do the same,” a saying that has been reflected through his works both past and present. </p>
