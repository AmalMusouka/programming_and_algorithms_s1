# The input of the program consists of 8 integers Ax, Ay, Bx, By, Cx, Cy, Dx, Dy that represent the coordinates of 4 points A, B, C, D in the Euclid plane.
#
# All numbers are on a single line, separated by spaces.
#
# The program should print ANO (Czech for yes), if the line segments AB and CD share at least one point; it should print NE (Czech for no) otherwise.
#
# As an example, for the input 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0, the answer is ANO (yes).







input = "0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0"
